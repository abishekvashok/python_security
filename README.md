# python_security

## Overview
This repository collects lists of security-relavent Python APIs, along with examples of exploits using those APIs. Currently it only contains remote code/command execution libraries.

## Usage

To work with the code in this repo, you must be in a virtual environment:

```
$ cd /path/to/python_security
$ python3.8 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip3.8 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Interactive Server

You can launch the server to interactively play with the examples:

```
(venv) $ FASK_APP=webapp.app.py FLASK_ENV=development flask run -h localhost -p 2121
```

This will let you generate payloads for arbitrary code, and run those payloads on your own machine.

### JSON Formatted Data

All the vulnerable functions covered by this repository are available in machine-readable format in `sinks.json`. `sinks.json` can be regenerated by running `scripts/generate_sink_list.py`.

### Testing

When adding a new exploit, you can validate it by running the tests:
```
(venv) $ python3 -m unittest
```
## Contributing

PRs are welcome. If you're looking for ideas, look at the "Future Work" section in `code_execution/README.md`. Before submitting an exploit, make sure to run the tests and include evidence of testing in the PR.
